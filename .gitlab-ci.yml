# This is a simple example illustrating how to build and test .NET Core project
# with GitLab Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery.

# ### Specify the Docker image
#
# Instead of installing .NET Core SDK manually, a docker image is used
# with already pre-installed .NET Core SDK.
#
# The 'latest' tag targets the latest available version of .NET Core SDK image.
# If preferred, you can explicitly specify version of .NET Core (e.g. using '2.2-sdk' tag).
#
# See other available tags for .NET Core: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet
# Learn more about Docker tags: https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=tag
# and the Docker itself: https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker
image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1

# ### Define variables
#
variables:
  # 1) Name of directory where restore and build objects are stored.
  OBJECTS_DIRECTORY: "obj"
  # 2) Name of directory used for keeping restored dependencies.
  NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY: ".nuget"
  # 3) A relative path to the source code from project repository root.
  # NOTE: Please edit this path so it matches the structure of your project!
  SOURCE_CODE_PATH: "src/"

# ### Define stage list
#
# In this example there are only two stages.
# Initially, the project will be built and then tested.
stages:
  - push
  - deploy

# stages:
#   - build
#   - test
#   - push
#   - deploy
  
# ### Define global cache rule
#
# Before building the project, all dependencies (e.g. third-party NuGet packages)
# must be restored. Jobs on GitLab.com's Shared Runners are executed on autoscaled machines.
#
# Each machine is used only once (for security reasons) and after that is removed.
# This means that, before every job, a dependency restore must be performed
# because restored dependencies are removed along with machines. Fortunately,
# GitLab provides cache mechanism with the aim of keeping restored dependencies
# for other jobs.
#
# This example shows how to configure cache to pass over restored
# dependencies for re-use.
#
# With global cache rule, cached dependencies will be downloaded before every job
# and then unpacked to the paths as specified below.
# cache:
#   # Per-stage and per-branch caching.
#   key: "$CI_JOB_STAGE-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
#   paths:
#     # Specify three paths that should be cached:
#     #
#     # 1) Main JSON file holding information about package dependency tree, packages versions,
#     # frameworks etc. It also holds information where to the dependencies were restored.
#     - "$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/project.assets.json"
#     # 2) Other NuGet and MSBuild related files. Also needed.
#     - "$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/*.csproj.nuget.*"
#     # 3) Path to the directory where restored dependencies are kept.
#     - "$NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY"
  #
  # 'pull-push' policy means that latest cache will be downloaded (if it exists)
  # before executing the job, and a newer version will be uploaded afterwards.
  # Such a setting saves time when there are no changes in referenced third-party
  # packages.
  #
  # For example, if you run a pipeline with changes in your code,
  # but with no changes within third-party packages which your project is using,
  # then project restore will happen quickly as all required dependencies
  # will already be there — unzipped from cache.

  # 'pull-push' policy is the default cache policy, you do not have to specify it explicitly.
  # policy: pull-push

# ### Restore project dependencies
#
# NuGet packages by default are restored to '.nuget/packages' directory
# in the user's home directory. That directory is out of scope of GitLab caching.
#
# To get around this, a custom path can be specified using the '--packages <PATH>' option
# for 'dotnet restore' command. In this example, a temporary directory is created
# in the root of project repository, so its content can be cached.
